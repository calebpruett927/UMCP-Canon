Scope and Intent
================

This repository is not a “model of the world.” It is a ledger.

The kernel is universal in form:
- It measures an admitted trace Ψ(t) and computes invariants that are stable under disclosed assumptions.
- It separates identities (Tier-1) from assumptions (closures) by construction.

Continuity is not asserted by narrative.
Continuity is asserted only where a return exists under a declared horizon, and the weld budget closes under disclosed closures.

If a return does not exist, the correct output is not metaphysics.
The correct output is a typed boundary: “no return observed,” and therefore no continuity credit.
