This folder is the repository’s canonical orientation layer: it fixes the scope boundary,
freezes definitions, and specifies the disclosure requirements for reproducible Tier-1 rows
and valid weld (continuity) claims. CANON.md states the anchors, tier discipline, and claim
criteria; CONTRACT.md records the frozen snapshot and seam rule; KERNEL.md defines Tier-0
admission and Tier-1 reserved identities; WELD.md defines ledger/budget/residual, typed
censoring, PASS conditions, and SS1m(weld) fields; REPRODUCIBILITY.md provides the minimal
checklist and export bundle layout; GLOSSARY.md is a quick reference; SCOPE.md states the
intent (“this repo is a ledger”) in one page.
